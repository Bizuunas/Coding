                The aurora borealis and aurora australis have dazzled us in the night sky for centuries. Here’s what
                causes
                them—and why we’re seeing them more lately.

                    Common in polar and sub-polar regions, auroras can sometimes be seen at lower latitudes, including
                    recent
                    dazzling displays as far south as Florida and England. If you live in the the contiguous United
                    States,
                    but
                    it seems like you’ve been able to see auroras far more often than you normally would—well, you’re
                    right.
                    Here’s why.
                </p>
                <p>No matter how many times you see them, the northern lights, or aurora borealis—and their Southern
                    Hemisphere
                    equivalent, the aurora australis—are an ethereal, breathtaking sight. Dancing silently in Earth’s
                    upper
                    atmosphere, they form iridescent sheets of green and red (or sometimes blue and purple) light.

                <h3>What are auroras, or the northern and southern lights?</h3>
                <p>
                    Italian astronomer <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/galileo-galilei">Galileo
                        Galilei,</a> coined the term aurora in 1619 after the Roman goddess of
                    dawn—mistakenly believing it to be the reflection of sunlight off the atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, both northern and southern lights are caused by the interaction of gases in Earth’s
                    atmosphere with the <a
                        href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/nmp/st5/SCIENCE/solarwind.html#:~:text=The%20solar%20wind%20is%20created,lines%20that%20extend%20radially%20outward.">solar
                        wind:</a> a stream of electrically charged particles, called ions, that shoot
                    out from the sun in all directions.
                </p>
                <a
                    href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/graphics/staring-at-the-sun-a-close-but-safe-look-at-our-home-star-feature">(Staring
                    at the sun: an interactive look at our dynamic home star.)
                </a>
                <p>
                    When the solar wind reaches Earth, it slams into the planet’s magnetic field, producing currents of
                    charged particles that flow toward the poles. Some of the ions become trapped in a layer of the
                    atmosphere called the <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/ionosphere">ionosphere,</a> where
                    they collide with gas atoms—primarily oxygen and
                    nitrogen—and "excite" them with extra energy. This energy then gets released as particles of light,
                    or <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/ionosphere">photons.</a>
